This is a chrome extension that I'm creating for myself. It's a web page that displays whenever
I open a new chrome tab.

# Features
* Organizes to-do list into: "Things that must be done today" and "Additional tasks"
* Inspirational quotes.
* Pretty background.
* Saves data to persistent local storage.
